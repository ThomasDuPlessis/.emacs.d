{\bf Upload your solution to Blackboard by the due date.}
You are expected to write up your solutions {\em on your own}, {\bf
without referring to other students' writeups or to solutions you may
find on the web}; you are welcome to discuss problems with me, the TA,
and classmates, but {\bf must do the writeup entirely on your own}.

\medskip
{\bf Do NOT write your name on your submission.} It is recorded with Blackboard, so we know who you are.  But we want your paper to be
anonymous, since it may be peer-assessed.

\noindent Recommended Reading: BKOS: Chapter 2; O'Rourke sections 7.7, 7.8. Handout on Melkman's algorithm.

\noindent {\bf (10).}  
Given a set $D$ of $n$ disjoint circular disks in the plane, and a set $S$ of $m$ points, 
devise an efficient algorithm to determine how many points are in each disk.
What is the running time (in big-Oh)?
