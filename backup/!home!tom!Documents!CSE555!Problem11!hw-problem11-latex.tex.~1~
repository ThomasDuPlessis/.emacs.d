{\bf Upload your solution to Blackboard by the due date.}
You are expected to write up your solutions {\em on your own}, {\bf
without referring to other students' writeups or to solutions you may
find on the web}; you are welcome to discuss problems with me, the TA,
and classmates, but {\bf must do the writeup entirely on your own}.

\medskip
{\bf Do NOT write your name on your submission.} It is recorded with Blackboard, so we know who you are.  But we want your paper to be
anonymous, since it may be peer-assessed.

\noindent {\bf (11).} 
Problem 2.14, BCKO/BKOS.
Let $S$ be a set of $n$ disjoint line segments in a plane,
and let $p$ be a point not on any of the line segments of
$S$. We wish to determine all line segments of $S$ that
$p$ can see, that is, all line segments of $S$ that contain
some point $q$ so that the open segment $\overline{pq}$
doesn't intersect any line segment of $S$. Give an
$O(n \log n)$ time algorithm for this problem that uses a rotating
half-line with its endpoint at~$p$.
