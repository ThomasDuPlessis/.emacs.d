{\bf Upload your solution to Blackboard by the due date.}
You are expected to write up your solutions {\em on your own}, {\bf
without referring to other students' writeups or to solutions you may
find on the web}; you are welcome to discuss problems with me, the TA,
and classmates, but {\bf must do the writeup entirely on your own}.

\medskip
{\bf Do NOT write your name on your submission.} It is recorded with Blackboard, so we know who you are.  But we want your paper to be
anonymous, since it may be peer-assessed.
\medskip

\noindent Recommended Reading: BKOS: Chapter 2; O'Rourke sections 7.7, 7.8. Handout on Melkman's algorithm.

\noindent {\bf (12).} 
Write an intersection
predicate, {\tt TriRayIntersectProp}, in C which takes five points,
$a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, which define a triangle, $\Delta abc$, and a ray,
$de$ (with endpoint $d$, pointing in the direction of point $e\neq d$), and
determines if they {\em properly} intersect or not. (In order to
intersect properly, there must exist a point
$p$ {\em interior} to the triangle and the ray
(more precisely, in the ``relative interior'' of each), not on the
boundary of the triangle or at the endpoint ($d$) of the ray.
(Note that the triangle 
must be nondegenerate for this to happen; i.e., if the triangle
is degenerate (a line segment or a point), then it has no
points in its interior); a triangle is considered to
be the (closed) convex hull of its three vertices.)

Your predicate should start:

\begin{verbatim}
bool   TriRayIntersectProp( tPointi a, tPointi b, tPointi c, 
                            tPointi d, tPointi e )
{

[FILL IN HERE]

}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent You may use the predicates from O'Rourke's book,
{\tt Area2}, {\tt Left}, {\tt
LeftOn}, {\tt Collinear}, {\tt IntersectProp}, {\tt Between}, and {\tt
Intersect} from the text, but try to think carefully about making your
code complete (handling all cases) and efficient (avoiding duplication
of tests).

{\em Note:} Even if you have never programmed in C before, this exercise should
be fairly straightforward; try to read and understand the code fragments
of section 1.5 of O'Rourke.
