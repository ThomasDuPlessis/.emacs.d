{\bf Upload your solution to Blackboard by the due date.}
You are expected to write up your solutions {\em on your own}, {\bf
without referring to other students' writeups or to solutions you may
find on the web}; you are welcome to discuss problems with me, the TA,
and classmates, but {\bf must do the writeup entirely on your own}.

\medskip
{\bf Do NOT write your name on your submission.} It is recorded with Blackboard, so we know who you are.  But we want your paper to be
anonymous, since it may be peer-assessed.

\noindent Recommended Reading: BCKO/BKOS: Chapter 3;
O'Rourke, Chapters 1 and 2.

\noindent {\bf (13).} 
(a). Give an example of a simple $n$-gon $P$ and a set $A$ of points within $P$
such that $A$ is a {\em minimal} guard set for $P$ (i.e., it is not possible to remove any points from $A$
while still guarding $P$), and $A$ has size $|A|=\Omega(n)$, while an optimal guard set (of {\em minimum} cardinality)
has size $g(P)=O(1)$.

(b). Answer part (a), now with an example that is rectilinear (all edges are axis-parallel).

(c). Give an example of a simple $n$-gon $P$ and a {\em maximal} set $B$ of independent witness points (i.e., it is not
possible to add any points to $B$ while keeping all of the points independent), of size $|B|=O(1)$,
such that the size of a {\em maximum} cardinality witness point set is $w(P)=\Omega(n)$.
