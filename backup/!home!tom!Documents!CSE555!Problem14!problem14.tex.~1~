{\bf Upload your solution to Blackboard by the due date.}
You are expected to write up your solutions {\em on your own}, {\bf
without referring to other students' writeups or to solutions you may
find on the web}; you are welcome to discuss problems with me, the TA,
and classmates, but {\bf must do the writeup entirely on your own}.

\medskip
{\bf Do NOT write your name on your submission.} It is recorded with Blackboard, so we know who you are.  But we want your paper to be
anonymous, since it may be peer-assessed.

\noindent Recommended Reading: BCKO/BKOS: Chapter 3;
O'Rourke, Chapters 1 and 2.

\noindent {\bf (14).} 
As we discussed in class, 
Chazelle has shown that one can determine if a given list of $n$ vertices
constitutes a simple polygon in time $O(n)$.  Using this as a ``black box'',
explain in detail how you would check if a simple polygon $P$ intersects
a simple polygon $Q$ in time $O(|P|+|Q|)$.
