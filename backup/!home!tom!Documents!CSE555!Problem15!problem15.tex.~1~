{\bf Upload your solution to Blackboard by the due date.}
You are expected to write up your solutions {\em on your own}, {\bf
without referring to other students' writeups or to solutions you may
find on the web}; you are welcome to discuss problems with me, the TA,
and classmates, but {\bf must do the writeup entirely on your own}.

\medskip
{\bf Do NOT write your name on your submission.} It is recorded with Blackboard, so we know who you are.  But we want your paper to be
anonymous, since it may be peer-assessed.

(a). Problem 3.2, BCKO/BKOS.
A {\em rectilinear polygon} is a simple polygon for which all edges
are horizontal or vertical.  Let $P$ be a rectilinear polygon with $n$
vertices.  Give an example to show that $\lfloor n/4\rfloor$ cameras
are sometimes necessary to guard it.  (Justify your answer!)

(b). Problem 3.3, BCKO/BKOS.
Prove or disprove: The dual graph of a triangulation of a
monotone polygon is always a path (i.e., any node in the graph has
degree at most two).  (Here, in the dual graph we ignore the face at
infinity -- nodes of the dual graph correspond to the triangles of the
triangulation.)

(c). Problem 3.4, BCKO/BKOS.
Suppose that a simple polygon $P$ with $n$ vertices is given, along
with a set of diagonals that partitions $P$ into convex quadrilaterals.
How many guards are sufficient to guard $P$?  Why does this not contradict
the Art Gallery Theorem?
