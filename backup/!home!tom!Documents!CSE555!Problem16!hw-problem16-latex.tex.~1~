{\bf Upload your solution to Blackboard by the due date.}
You are expected to write up your solutions {\em on your own}, {\bf
without referring to other students' writeups or to solutions you may
find on the web}; you are welcome to discuss problems with me, the TA,
and classmates, but {\bf must do the writeup entirely on your own}.

\noindent {\bf (16).} 
As we know, Fisk's proof method gives us a means of placing guards at
vertices of a simple polygon.  The set of guards it produces need not
be optimal, of course.  Further, the set of guards produced depends on
the particular triangulation used -- some triangulations ${\cal T}$ of
simple polygon $P$ lead to a much smaller set of guards, using the
Fisk method, than other triangulations. (We know there can be {\em
  lots} of different triangulations for some polygons.)

Could it be that if we used the ``right'' choice of triangulation of $P$,
the Fisk method would actually give an {\em optimal} set of vertex guards?
Give an example of a simple polygon $P$ for which {\em every}
triangulation of $P$ is ``bad'' in the sense that Fisk's proof method
gives ``many more'' guards than an optimal set of vertex guards.  Try to make your
example as ``bad'' as possible, to maximize the ratio of the number of
guards produced by Fisk's method, on the ``best'' among all
triangulations, to the number of guards, $g_V(P)$, in an optimal cover
using vertex guards.

\medskip
(For extra thought/fun (optional -- not to turn in, but can be an
optional project): Give an efficient algorithm to find the best
triangulation of $P$, yielding the fewest vertex guards possible using
the Fisk method.)
