{\bf Upload your solution to Blackboard by the due date.}
You are expected to write up your solutions {\em on your own}, {\bf
without referring to other students' writeups or to solutions you may
find on the web}; you are welcome to discuss problems with me, the TA,
and classmates, but {\bf must do the writeup entirely on your own}.

\medskip
{\bf Do NOT write your name on your submission.} It is recorded with Blackboard, so we know who you are.  But we want your paper to be
anonymous, since it may be peer-assessed.

\noindent {\bf (17).}  
For each of the simple polygons $P$ below, do the following:

(a). Show a set of diagonals that yield a triangulation of $P$.

(b). Apply the method of Fisk's proof to obtain a set of at
most $\lfloor n/3\rfloor$ (vertex) guards.  How many guards do you
use?

(c). By inspection, obtain the {\em vertex} guard number
for $P$; i.e., find the minimum number of vertex guards necessary to
guard the polygon.  Justify your answer! In particular, give an
argument that fewer guards cannot suffice.

(d). By inspection, obtain the {\em point} guard number for
$P$, allowing guards to be placed at {\em any} point (interior or
boundary) of the polygon.  Justify your answer! (Give an argument that
fewer guards cannot suffice.)

                  \psfig{file=hw-problem17-polygon2.eps,height=2.0in}\hfill}

(e). 
Compute the
{\em boundary guard number}, $g_{\partial P}(P)$, which is defined
to be the minimum number of guards needed to illuminate
all of the polygon, subject to the constraint that each guard must
be a point on the boundary, $\partial P$, of $P$ (it can lie at a vertex or
interior to an edge of $P$). Justify your answer! (Give an argument that
fewer guards cannot suffice.)
