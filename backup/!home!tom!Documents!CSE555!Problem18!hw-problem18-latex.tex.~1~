\medskip
\noindent {\bf (18).} 
The Hertel-Mehlhorn algorithm was shown to be within factor 4 of
optimal.  (See section 2.4 of O'Rourke.)  

(a). Here is a proposed method for placing guards in a polygon $P$:
Use the Hertel-Mehlhorn algorithm to decompose $P$ into a small number
of convex pieces.  (We know that the number of pieces is ``small'' in
the sense that it will be at most 4 times the minimum possible number
of pieces.)  For each convex piece, place a guard in it (anywhere).
Does this give a set of guards that is ``close'' to an optimal set of
guards (having the fewest possible point guards)?  Why or why not?

(b). Find a generic family of examples\footnote{i.e., a class of
  examples so that the size of the polygon (number of vertices) can be
  made to be arbitrarily large} of simple polygons having $r$ reflex
vertices, and a triangulation of each, such that there exists
a triangulation and an order of inessential diagonal removal such that 
the Hertel-Mehlhorn
algorithm produces a partitioning into $2r+1$ convex polygons, while
an optimal partitioning results in only $\lceil r/2\rceil +1$ convex
polygons.

(c). Argue that if one starts with the ``right'' triangulation
of $P$ and deletes inessential diagonals in the ``right'' order,
then the algorithm will in fact give an {\em optimal} decomposition
into (the exact minimum number of) convex pieces.

(d). [Optional challenge for extra thought (not required)]: 
Consider part (a) again.
Can we find a family of examples for which {\em any} triangulation
has an ordering of deletion in the Hertel-Mehlhorn algorithm
that leads to a ``bad'' result (factor 4 away from optimal)?
The point of this question is to try to separate the 
two places where the algorithm makes choices:  the triangulation,
and the deletion order of diagonals.
