{\bf Upload your solution to Blackboard by the due date.}
You are expected to write up your solutions {\em on your own}, {\bf
without referring to other students' writeups or to solutions you may
find on the web}; you are welcome to discuss problems with me, the TA,
and classmates, but {\bf must do the writeup entirely on your own}.

\medskip
{\bf Do NOT write your name on your submission.} It is recorded with Blackboard, so we know who you are.  But we want your paper to be
anonymous, since it may be peer-assessed.

\noindent {\bf (19).}  
Let $H$ be a set of at least three half-planes with a non-empty
intersection such that not all bounding lines are parallel. We call a
half-plane $h \in H$ {\em redundant} if it does not contribute an edge
to $\bigcap H$.  Prove that for any redundant half-plane $h\in H$
there are two half-planes $h', h'' \in H$ such that $h'\cap h''
\subset h$.  Give an $O(n\log n)$ time algorithm to compute all
redundant half-planes.
