{\bf Upload your solution to Blackboard by the due date.}
You are expected to write up your solutions {\em on your own}, {\bf
without referring to other students' writeups or to solutions you may
find on the web}; you are welcome to discuss problems with me, the TA,
and classmates, but {\bf must do the writeup entirely on your own}.

{\bf Do NOT write your name on your submission.} It is recorded with Blackboard, so we know who you are.  But we want your paper to be
anonymous, since it may be peer-assessed.

\noindent {\bf (2).} 
Let $R$ be a set of $n_R$ ``red'' points in the plane.
Let $B$ be a set of $n_B$ ``blue'' points in the plane.
Suppose we know the convex hulls, $CH(R)$ and $CH(B)$, having $h_R$ and $h_B$ vertices, respectively,
given as cyclic lists of their vertices.
We want to compute the convex hull, $CH(R\cup B)$, of the $n=n_R+n_B$ points.

(a). In terms of $h_R$ and $h_B$, what is the maximum possible number of vertices of $CH(R\cup B)$?
What is the minimum possible number of such vertices?

(b). How efficiently can we compute $CH(R\cup B)$?  Explain.

(c). In class, we discussed the divide-and-conquer approach to
computing the convex hull of a set of $n$ points in the plane. (See
also problem 1.8, Chapter 1.)  Suppose now that the method of dividing
is {\em not} to split according to the $x$-median, but, rather, is an
arbitrary split of the input points $S$ into two sets, $S_1$ and
$S_2$, of sizes $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ and $\lceil n/2\rceil$.  Use your
answer to part (b) to describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the
convex hull of $n$ points in the plane.
