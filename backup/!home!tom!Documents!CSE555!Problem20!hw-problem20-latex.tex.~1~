{\bf Upload your solution to Blackboard by the due date.}
You are expected to write up your solutions {\em on your own}, {\bf
without referring to other students' writeups or to solutions you may
find on the web}; you are welcome to discuss problems with me, the TA,
and classmates, but {\bf must do the writeup entirely on your own}.

\medskip
{\bf Do NOT write your name on your submission.} It is recorded with Blackboard, so we know who you are.  But we want your paper to be
anonymous, since it may be peer-assessed.

\noindent {\bf (20).} 
There is a stretch of highway; we model the highway as the $x$-axis, for $x\in [0,1]$.
Along the highway, there are ``happy'' events where flowers bloom; a flower at position 
$u_i\in[0,1]$ blooms at happy time $h_i$, for $i=1,\ldots,m$, and stays in bloom.
Sadly, there are also ``sad'' events where squirrels get killed; a squirrel
at position $v_i\in[0,1]$ gets killed at sad time $s_i$, for $i=1,\ldots,n$.
Suppose you have perfect knowledge of when and where all of these events will occur;
i.e., you know all $2(m+n)$ of the values $u_i, h_i, v_i, s_i$.
Now, you are planning a trip with your kids, and you must drive along the highway from $x=0$ to $x=1$.
Your goal is to plan a departure time, $t_0$, and select a driving speed, $V$, so that 
your kids see all of the happy events (flowers in bloom), and none of the sad events (dead squirrels in the road).
It may not be possible to do this.  
Describe a method of determining if it is possible, and, if it is, of producing
a time $t_0$ and a speed $V$ for the journey.
Try to make the method as efficient as possible, and give the running time in big-Oh notation
as a function of $m$ and $n$.
