{\bf Upload your solution to Blackboard by the due date.}
You are expected to write up your solutions {\em on your own}, {\bf
without referring to other students' writeups or to solutions you may
find on the web}; you are welcome to discuss problems with me, the TA,
and classmates, but {\bf must do the writeup entirely on your own}.

\medskip
{\bf Do NOT write your name on your submission.} It is recorded with Blackboard, so we know who you are.  But we want your paper to be
anonymous, since it may be peer-assessed.

\noindent {\bf (21).} 
On $n$ parallel lanes of a super-highway $n$ cars are going with constant speeds
$v_1, v_2,\ldots, v_n$.  At time $t = 0$ the cars are at positions
$k_1, k_2,\ldots, k_n$. Give an $O(n\log n)$ algorithm that detects
all cars that at some moment in time are leading.
