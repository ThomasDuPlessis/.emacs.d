{\bf Upload your solution to Blackboard by the due date.}
You are expected to write up your solutions {\em on your own}, {\bf
without referring to other students' writeups or to solutions you may
find on the web}; you are welcome to discuss problems with me, the TA,
and classmates, but {\bf must do the writeup entirely on your own}.

\medskip
{\bf Do NOT write your name on your submission.} It is recorded with Blackboard, so we know who you are.  But we want your paper to be
anonymous, since it may be peer-assessed.

\noindent {\bf (22).} 
In class we sketched a dynamic programming algorithm for computing a
minimum-weight (total edge length) triangulation of a simple polygon
$P$ having $n$ vertices.  Suppose now that our goal is to find a
triangulation of $P$ that minimizes the maximum among the {\em areas} of
the $n-2$ triangles.   Give a DP algorithm to solve this problem. What is the
running time (in big-Oh notation)?
