{\bf Upload your solution to Blackboard by the due date.}
You are expected to write up your solutions {\em on your own}, {\bf
without referring to other students' writeups or to solutions you may
find on the web}; you are welcome to discuss problems with me, the TA,
and classmates, but {\bf must do the writeup entirely on your own}.

\medskip
{\bf Do NOT write your name on your submission.} It is recorded with Blackboard, so we know who you are.  But we want your paper to be
anonymous, since it may be peer-assessed.

\noindent {\bf (3).} 
Problem 1.10, parts (a)-(d), page 17, BCKO/BKOS:
{\em Let $S$ be a set of $n$ (possibly intersecting) unit circles in the plane. We
want to compute the convex hull of $S$.

(a). Show that the boundary of the convex hull of $S$ consists of straight
line segments and pieces of circles in $S$.

(b). Show that each circle can occur at most once on the boundary of the
convex hull.

(c). Let $S'$ be the set of points that are the centers of the circles in $S$. Show
that a circle in $S$ appears on the boundary of the convex hull if and
only if the center of the circle lies on the convex hull of $S'$.

(d). Give an $O(n\log n)$ algorithm for computing the convex hull of $S$.}

Note: Clarification of part (b): The number of times that a disk (circle) $D$
``occurs'' on the convex hull is the number of connected components of the
set $X\cap D$, where $X$ is the set of extreme points of the convex hull of
the circles (and we consider each circle $D$ to be a {\em closed} region (disk).

(e). [Optional]
Show that the convex hull of $n$ spherical balls (possibly of different radii) in 3D can have boundary complexity $\Omega(n^2)$.
In contrast, the convex hull of $n$ cubes (of any size/orientation) in 3D has boundary complexity $O(n)$; do you see why?
