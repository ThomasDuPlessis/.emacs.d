{\bf Upload your solution to Blackboard by the due date.}
You are expected to write up your solutions {\em on your own}, {\bf
without referring to other students' writeups or to solutions you may
find on the web}; you are welcome to discuss problems with me, the TA,
and classmates, but {\bf must do the writeup entirely on your own}.

\medskip
{\bf Do NOT write your name on your submission.} It is recorded with Blackboard, so we know who you are.  But we want your paper to be
anonymous, since it may be peer-assessed.

\noindent Recommended Reading: BCKO Chapter 1.  O'Rourke, Chapter 3. 

\noindent {\bf (4).} 
Based on Problem 1.7, Chapter 1, BCKO/BKOS. (Read that problem for further information.)
This has to do with the ``Jarvis march'' algorithm we discussed in class.

Consider the following alternative approach to computing the conex hull of a set of points in the
plane: We start with the rightmost point. This is the first point $p_1$ of the convex hull.
Now imagine that we start with a vertical line through $p_1$ and rotate it clockwise until it hits another point $p_2$. This is the second point (vertex) on the convex hull.  We continue rotating the line but this time around $p_2$ until we hit a point $p_3$.  In this way we continue until we reach $p_1$ again. 

(a).  What degenerate cases can occur and how can we deal with them?  Draw pictures to illustrate.

(b).  What problems might occur when we deal with inexact floating point arithmetic?
