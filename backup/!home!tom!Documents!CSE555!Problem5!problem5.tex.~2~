\noindent {\bf (5).} 
Recall that we spoke about computing the {\em FarthestPair} for $n$ points on a line;
this is easily done in time $O(n)$.
Now, let us consider points in 2D.  (See related problem in O'Rourke, Chapter 3, page 99.)
Let $S=\{p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n\}$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane.
The {\em diameter}, $diam(S)$, of $S$ is the largest (Euclidean)
distance between two points of $S$.  A {\em line of support} for a set
$X$ is a line $\ell$ that intersects $X$ and has $X$ fully contained
in one of the (closed) halfplanes that $\ell$ defines (on one side or
the other of $\ell$).

(a). Show that the diameter, $diam(S)$, is realized as the distance
between two points, $p_i,p_j\in S$, that are vertices of the convex
hull $CH(S)$; i.e., if $diam(S)=|p_ip_j|$, then $p_i$ and $p_j$ are
vertices (extreme points) of the convex hull, $CH(S)$.


\textbf{A: Proof, take the two points $p_i$ and $p_j$ in plane, and rotate the
  entire point set so that the line between $p_i$ and $p_j$ is parallel to the
  y-axis with $p_i$ on the bottom. Since no two points are longer then the
  points distance between $p_i$ and $p_j$, then $p_i$ have the minimum
  y-coordinate and $p_j$ must have the largest y-coordinate. Take $p_i$, if we
  take any point to the right (or directly above, vertically), say, $p_{i-1}$,
  and any point to the right (or directly above vertically), $p_{i+1}$. Then
  $p_{i-1}$,$p_i$, $p_{i+1}$ can not form a left turn, otherwise $p_{i+1}$ would
  be lower (smaller y) then $p_i$ which would mean |$p_if$ $p_j$| is not the
  longest distance. Since, no other points can form a left turn with $p_i$ as
  median point, it must be on the CH. We can do a similar argument with $p_j$.}


(b).  Show that the diameter $diam(S)$ is the same as the maximum
distance between two parallel lines of support for $S$.

(c). Two extreme points $p_i$ and $p_j$ are {\em antipodal} if there exist
parallel lines of support, $\ell_i$ and $\ell_j$, with $p_i\in\ell_i$
and $p_j\in\ell_j$, and all other points of $S$ strictly between $\ell_i$ and $\ell_j$.  
Develop an algorithm for enumerating (listing)
all antipodal pairs of $S$.  (Hint: Imagine rotating a pair of
parallel lines of support around $S$; when does the antipodal pair
change?)  What is the running time of your algorithm?
