You are expected to write up your solutions {\em on your own}, {\bf
without referring to other students' writeups or to solutions you may
find on the web}; you are welcome to discuss problems with me, the TA,
and classmates, but {\bf must do the writeup entirely on your own}.

{\bf Do NOT write your name on your submission.} It is recorded with Blackboard, so we know who you are.  But we want your paper to be
anonymous, since it may be peer-assessed.

\noindent {\bf (8).} 
(a). Assume that we execute Melkman's convex hull algorithm
on the vertices of the chain shown below in the order $v_0$, $v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$,
etc. (In the figure, I label $v_i$ with ``$i$''.)  Show the deque,
clearly indicating the ``top'' $d_t$ and ``bottom'' $d_b$ at each step of the algorithm.
Also, which two Left tests are done at each step, in order to determine if $v_i$ lies within
the convex hull so far?

\textbf{A: starting with the initialized state of the deque, we get the following sequence: }
\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | p{5cm} | } 
 \hline
   Step Number & Deque State ($<d_b,...,d_t>$) & Left Tests & Description\\
 \hline\hline
   1 & $<2,1,0,2>$ & Left(0,2,3), Left(2,1,3)   & First step after initializing the Deque\\ 
 \hline
   2 & $<3,2,1,3>$ & Left(1,3,4), Left(3,2,4)   & After restoring convexity and adding point 3\\
 \hline
   3 & $<4,3,2,1,4>$ & Left(1,4,5), Left(4,3,5) & \\
 \hline
   4 & $<4,3,2,1,4>$ & Left(1,4,6), Left(4,3,6) & ignoring point 5 and continuing loop\\
 \hline
   5 & $<6,3,2,1,6>$ & Left(1,6,7), Left(6,3,7) & \\
 \hline
   6 & $<6,3,2,1,6>$ & Left(1,6,8), Left(6,3,8) & ignoring point 7 and continuing loop\\ 
 \hline
   6 & $<8,3,2,1,6,8>$ & Left(6,8,9), Left(8,3,9) & \\
 \hline
   6 & $<8,3,2,1,6,8>$ & Left(6,8,10), Left(8,3,10) &  ignoring 9 and continuing loop\\
 \hline
   6 & $<10,3,2,1,6,10>$ & Left(6,10,11), Left(10,3,11) & \\
 \hline
   6 & $<11,10,3,2,1,6,11>$ & Left(6,11,12), Left(11,10,12) & \\
 \hline
   6 & $<11,10,3,2,1,6,11>$ & Left(6,11,13), Left(11,10,13) & ignoring 12 and continuing loop\\
 \hline
   6 & $<13,11,10,3,2,1,6,11,13>$ & Left(6,11,14), Left(11,10,14) & \\
 \hline
   6 & $<13,11,10,3,2,1,6,11,13>$ & Left(6,11,14), Left(11,10,14) & done, after ignoring 14\\
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


(b).  For each of the following sequences of deques, determine if there is a simple chain for which
Melkman's algorithm would give the sequence.  If there is a chain compatible with the execution sequence of deques, draw one;
if not, say why not.

\noindent (i). $<2,1,0,2>, <2,1,0,2>, <3,0,2,1,3>, <4,0,2,1,3,4>$ 


\textbf{A: This cannot happen because the point 0 somehow gets popped from the
  deque then inserted back, or removed from the deque then pushed back on }

\noindent (ii). $<2,1,0,2>, <3,2,1,0,3>, <4,3,2,1,0,4>, <5,4,3,2,1,0,5>$

\noindent (iii). $<2,1,0,2>, <3,1,0,3>, <4,1,0,4>, <5,1,0,5>$

\noindent (iv). $<2,1,0,2>, <3,0,1,3>, <4,1,0,4>, <5,0,1,5>$

\medskip

(c). The following algorithm is proposed to compute the lower hull of
a simple chain in linear time: The input is a chain ($p_0$,
$p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1}$) of $n$ points; we assume that $p_0$ is the
leftmost among the $n$ points and that $p_{n-1}$ is the rightmost
among the $n$ points.  We assume also that there are no degeneracies:
there are no three points that are collinear, and no two points have
the same $x$- or $y$-coordinate.  The algorithm simply follows the
Graham scan idea: Maintain a chain $C$ that is ``left-turning'' as we
sweep through the points from $p_1$ to $p_{n-1}$.
If the next processed point lies to the right of the last edge of the
chain $C$, then we pop points off of the chain until the new point can
be added (pushed) onto the chain while obeying the left turning
property; if the next processed point lies to the left of the last
edge of the chain $C$, then simply add the new point onto the chain
$C$.
What goes wrong with this algorithm?  Give an explicit example where it
fails to find the correct lower hull of a simple chain.
