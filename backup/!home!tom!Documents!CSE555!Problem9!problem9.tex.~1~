{\bf Upload your solution to Blackboard by the due date.}
You are expected to write up your solutions {\em on your own}, {\bf
without referring to other students' writeups or to solutions you may
find on the web}; you are welcome to discuss problems with me, the TA,
and classmates, but {\bf must do the writeup entirely on your own}.

\medskip
{\bf Do NOT write your name on your submission.} It is recorded with Blackboard, so we know who you are.  But we want your paper to be
anonymous, since it may be peer-assessed.

\noindent Recommended Reading: BKOS: Chapter 2; O'Rourke sections 7.7, 7.8. Handout on Melkman's algorithm.

\noindent {\bf (9).} 
(a). (Based on Problem 2.5, BCKO/BKOS.)
Which of the following equalities are always true?  If always true, state briefly why it is the case;
if not always true, give an example where it fails to be true, clearly indicating what the left/right side of the equation gives for your example.
(i). $Twin(Twin(e)) = e$; (ii). $Next(Prev(e))=e$; (iii). $Twin(Prev(Twin(e)))=Next(e)$;
(iv). $IncidentFace(e) = IncidentFace(Next(e))$.

(b). Problem 2.6, BCKO/BKOS.
Give an example of a doubly-connected edge list where for an edge $e$
the faces {\em IncidentFace(e)} and {\em IncidentFace(Twin(e))} are
the same.

(c). Problem 2.7, BCKO/BKOS.
Given a doubly-connected edge list representation of a subdivision where {\em Twin(e)= Next(e)} holds
for every half-edge e, how many faces can the subdivision have at most?
