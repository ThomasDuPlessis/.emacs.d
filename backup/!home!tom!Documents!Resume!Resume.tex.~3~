\datedsubsection{Summer Technology Analyst, Citi}{Summer 2015}
{\color{default} Worked on several projects on a team developing a front office
  platform. I added JSON support to the backend trade processing system so that
  JSON formatted trade information can be sent through an API call. I also made
  a Stress test program for our backend using Gatling and Scala.  }

\datedsubsection{Software Engineering Intern, Kongsberg ITS}{Summer 2014} 
{\color{default} Worked on a digital radio system: doing socket programming in
  C++ (UDP mostly) as well as GUI development in C\# for a military vehicle
  control system. I wrote testing software for the control system as well in C++
  and C\# that communicated over a CAN bus.  }

{\color{titleColor}\section{Projects/Open Source Contributions}}
\subsection{\textbf{Visual SLAM Robotics Implementation (course project)}}
Final project for graduate Computer Vision course on a team of two. We
implemented a version of the SLAM algorithm for a real robot based off the
paper: \href{
  ''http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~cmei/articles/AConstantTimeEfficientStereoSLAMSystem_rss_09.pdf''}{A
  Constant Time Stereo Slam} which details an efficient method to localize and
map a robot's environment through live a video feed using C++ and openCV (Code
located on github).
\subsection{\textbf{Emacs-Eclim (open source project)}}
I am a contributor to the open source project “emacs-eclim” which provides an
interface for emacs to use Eclim,a backend code completion and project manager
backend for text editors, using Eclipse. I helped add Scala completion and error
checking to the Emacs eclim project. 
\subsection{\textbf{Thredge (website)}}
A personal project I did in Haskell, it's a web app that allows users to pool
money (Bitcoin) into a common account if they reach a certain threshold, and
then allows the owner to tag transactions to let the pledgers know how their
money is being spent. Uses: Scotty, Hastache, Blockchain.info api, and AWS for
deployment and Databases.
\subsection{\textbf{Friend Finder App (Android app)}}
Competed at Mhacks (2013) where we built an android app that would point to a
fellow android who had the same app so that you can find your friends. I helped
code the formulas to determine the angles and implemented a page with your
locations on a map using Google APIs.

{\color{titleColor}\section{About Me}} I am looking for an internship for the
Summer 2016, before the start of grad school. My main academic interests are in
Algorithms, particularly Computational Geometry. I'm also a functional
programming and GNU/Linux enthusiast with an appreciation for pure math
(particularly, abstract algebra). \\
