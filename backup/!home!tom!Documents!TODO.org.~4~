- Said I already applied? email career people?
I am currently a Senior set to graduate my undergraduate degree this Spring but
am continuing for a Master's the following year. I have two previous internship
experiences. I am also a functional programmer, using Haskell in particular,
which is one of the big reasons I was interested in applying to facebook; being
so impressed with the work being done with Haskell like Haxl and Sigma.

I am a big emacs user and have contributed to a few Emacs libraries such as
Emacs-eclim which offers IDE like features for Java and other JVM langauges
using hte Eclim backend, as well as Emacs auto complete, emacs pdf-tools which
allows you to view pdf documents in emacs efficiently, and ghc-mod provides ide
like features for haskell.
